      <p class="intro"> <strong> What is the truth about air pollution and how does it effect you?  </strong></p>

    <p class="info">
      <strong>Air pollution is the release of pollutants into the air</strong> and is caused by the burning of fossil fuels which can release dangerous gas and chemicals into the air. Some of these pollutants are greenhouse gasses like CO2, water vapor, methane, and nitrous oxide which when released into the atmosphere, trap heat and warm the earth. While it is normal for such gasses to be in the atmosphere, we've never seen such an overwhelming abundance of these gasses as we do now. The abundance of these gasses is not only heating up the atmosphere at an impossibly alarming rate, but as a result air quality in countless countries is diminishing. It's to the point where it's not safe to breathe atmospheric air in certain places as countless countries are reporting thousands of deaths being traced back to air pollution. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), "each year air pollution is responsible for nearly seven million deaths around the globe."

    <h3>Outdoor air pollution is a major environmental health problem affecting everyone in low-, middle-, and high-income countries.</h3>
    <p class="info">
      
      Ambient (outdoor) air pollution in both cities and rural areas was estimated to cause 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide per year in 2019; this mortality is due to exposure to fine particulate matter, which causes cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and cancers. <br><br>
      WHO estimates that in 2019, some 37% of outdoor air pollution-related premature deaths were due to ischaemic heart disease and stroke, 18% and 23% of deaths were due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute lower respiratory infections respectively, and 11% of deaths were due to cancer within the respiratory tract. <br> <br>
      People living in low- and middle-income countries disproportionately experience the burden of outdoor air pollution with 89% (of the 4.2 million premature deaths) occurring in these areas. The greatest burden is found in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions. The latest burden estimates reflect the significant role air pollution plays in cardiovascular illness and death. <br>

    <h3>How is it caused?</h3>
    <p class="info">
      Most air pollution is actually created by people in the forms of factory, plane, and aerosol emmisions. <strong>Naturally occuring air pollution such as smokefrom fires and ash from volcanos are called natural sources. </strong>Second-hand cigarette smoke can also be considered air pollution. <strong>Man-made sources of pollution are called anthropogenic sources..</strong> <br> <br>
      Residential pollution, mostly from cooking and heating using biomass, and generating electricity from fossil fuels for our homes, and transport, are the main human-made sources of fine particles globally. Windblown dust is also a major source in portions of Africa and West Asia that are close to deserts. <br><br>
      The fine particles that pollute our air mostly come from human activities such as burning fossil fuels to generate electricity, transportation, waste burning, agriculture — a major source of methane and ammonia -- and the chemical and mining industries. Natural sources include volcanic eruptions, sea spray, soil dust, and lightning. <br><br>
      In developing countries, reliance on wood and other solid fuels, like raw coal for cooking, heating and lighting, and the use of kerosene for lighting, increases air pollution in homes.

    <p class="info">
     There are two major types of air pollution. <strong>Smog</strong> occurs when emitting combusting fossil fuels react with sunlight. Ozone pollution is not only causing the arctic to melt at the fastest rate it ever has, but having the greatest impact in the region of origination, is the reason some areas are significantly warmer than others. </p>
    <p class="info">
     <strong> Soot </strong> which is also known as particulate matter or any solid or liquid substance transferred into the air according to nrdc.org, "is mainly made up of tiny particles of chemicals, soil, smoke, dust, or allergens—in the form of either gas or solids—that are carried in the air."</p>
    <p class="info">
     <strong >Both smog and soot are products of cars, trucks, factories, power plants, incinerators, engines, and anything that burns fossil fuels such as coal, gas, or natural gas.</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion..</h2>
    <p class="info">
      In conclusion, air pollution awareness highlight both the progress made and the challenges that persist. By leveraging educational initiatives, engaging media channels, fostering community involvement, and embracing technological advancements, we can collectively work towards a future where increased awareness translates into tangible actions to combat air pollution.<strong>Through collaboration and advocacy</strong>, individuals can play a crucial role in shaping policies, adopting sustainable practices, and contributing to a healthier, cleaner environment. The insights gathered from these articles serve as a foundation for developing effective strategies to amplify air pollution awareness and drive positive change.
